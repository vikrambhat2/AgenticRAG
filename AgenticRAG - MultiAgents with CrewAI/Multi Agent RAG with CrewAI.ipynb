    "- **LLMAgent**: Processes retrieved content and generates responses while ensuring answers are strictly grounded in the document.  \n",

    "The system follows a **multi-step workflow** where agents collaborate to ensure accuracy, reducing hallucination risks. This approach is useful for **research papers, legal documents, reports, or any structured knowledge retrieval task**.  \n",
